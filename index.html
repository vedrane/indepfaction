    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HOFA_PHARMACY/">HOFA</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SEGPRT/">SEGPRT</a>... <b>we trust neither of them.</b> In the war that is being waged, no longer must you choose between two sides. <b>We are the third option.</b></p>
    <p>To take these both sides down, WE as a PEOPLE must UNITE. That's why we formed the <b>INDEPENDENT FACTION</b>. I, therefore, invite you to join. But this will only work if you want it to.</p>
    <p>So then the choice is yours. <a href="https://discord.gg/KXQj7vfNFd">https://discord.gg/KXQj7vfNFd</a></p>
